    description: 'Hi, I am Bionca Bond, Software Developer and Data Analyst on the side at Zillow from Morrisville NC. My work history started in the automotive industry as Buyer then I decided to merge my professional and personal interest into tech. Always seeking new and exciting things to learn, I took advantage of a Software Engineer Apprenticeship program offered with Zillow to continue sharpening my tech tool belt. My journey with Code Fellows has been challenging but has aided me in discovering more about myself and the vastness of this expanding career field. My goal as a full-stack developer is to use Javascript, React, Python and other developer tools to provide creative business solutions. I believe that I can be a representation for other minorities eager to get into software development and bringing those different views along with that process is my secret sauce.'
